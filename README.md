# Image Sentiment Analysis

This repository provides a Jupyter Notebook that implements an Image Sentiment Analysis model. The model processes images and attempts to classify the sentiment or emotion expressed within them. The approach uses transfer learning with pre-trained models for feature extraction and a custom classification layer to output sentiment predictions.

## Overview
The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with transfer learning to perform sentiment classification on images. By leveraging a pre-trained model, we reduce training time and improve performance due to the generalized image features learned by the model on a large dataset.

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/176422324?v=4
   cd image-sentiment-analysis
2. **Install Required Libraries**: Ensure you have the following packages installed. You can install them using pip.
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy
3. **Jupyter Notebook**: If you haven't already, install Jupyter Notebook to run the notebook.
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: Start the Jupyter Notebook server and open Image Sentiment Analysis.ipynb .
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
## Data Preparation
The model requires a dataset of labeled images with sentiment annotations. You can use datasets with labeled emotions or download an open-source image sentiment dataset. Organize the dataset in subdirectories based on sentiment classes (e.g., happy, sad, angry).

## Model Training
The notebook leverages a transfer learning approach using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception, which has been previously trained on a large image dataset like ImageNet. This technique helps the model utilize complex, learned image features, such as edge detection and object composition, without needing to train from scratch, thereby improving performance and reducing the computational requirements.

## Evaluation and Validation
Cross-Validation:

Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation of the model.

Confusion Matrix Analysis:

Analyze the confusion matrix to identify specific classes where the model struggles.

Error Analysis:

Inspect misclassified images to understand model weaknesses and improve data or architecture.

### Steps in Model Training:
1. **Load the Pre-trained Model**:
   We load a popular CNN model with pre-trained weights. The convolutional layers are retained as they capture general image features. Only the final fully connected layers, which are specific to the original task, are removed.

2. **Freezing Layers**:
   To preserve the learned features from the pre-trained model, the convolutional layers are "frozen." This prevents them from being updated during training, allowing only the new layers to be trained on our specific dataset.

3. **Adding Custom Layers**:
   New dense layers are added on top of the pre-trained model to tailor it for sentiment classification. These layers are trained to learn the patterns specific to emotions within images. Common additions include:
   - A **Global Average Pooling** layer to reduce dimensionality and convert feature maps into a more compact representation.
   - Fully connected **Dense layers** with activation functions such as ReLU to model the sentiment classifications.
   - A final **Softmax layer** that outputs the probability distribution across sentiment classes (e.g., happy, sad, neutral).

4. **Compilation and Hyperparameters**:
   The model is compiled with a categorical cross-entropy loss function (suitable for multi-class classification) and an optimizer like Adam. Key hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, are set to optimize performance.

5. **Training the Model**:
   Using our labeled sentiment dataset, the model is trained over multiple epochs. The training process involves adjusting the weights in the newly added layers to minimize the loss function and improve the model's accuracy in sentiment classification.

6. **Validation**:
   During training, the model's performance is validated on a separate validation set to monitor overfitting. Metrics such as validation loss and accuracy are tracked to fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.

By the end of the training process, the model has learned to recognize and classify sentiment-related patterns in images. This transfer learning approach not only expedites training but also helps achieve a higher level of accuracy compared to training from scratch.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using accuracy metrics, and confusion matrices to assess its ability to correctly classify different sentiments.

## Results
The modelâ€™s performance is summarized in terms of accuracy and class-wise metrics. Use the visualizations to analyze which sentiment classes perform well and which might need more data or fine-tuning.
